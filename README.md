# ♻️ **REMWasteTest**

Hello, and thank you for checking out this project! Here's a brief explanation of how I approached the redesign.

---

## ⚙️ **Project Setup**

- Initialized the project using **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** for better performance and a faster development experience.  
- Used **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** for styling and responsive design.  
- Customized the theme colors in the Tailwind configuration to align with the new design direction.

## 🗂️ **Project Structure**

- All **pages** are located in the `/pages` folder (currently just one).
- **Reusable components** are stored in the `/components` folder.
- For larger projects, I follow a more scalable structure:  
  `/components/{PageName}/{ComponentName}`

## 🎨 **Design Decisions**

- The original color palette (dark blue on dark gray) felt too harsh on the eyes.
- Replaced the dark blue with a **teal** color for a more modern and accessible look.
- Redesigned the cards for improved visual clarity and user experience.
- Enhanced responsive design, especially in the following sections:
  - **Booking Stepper**
  - **Selection Grid**
  - **Skip Selected Summary**

## 🖼️ **Card Images**

- Since I couldn’t find image links in the provided data, I added a placeholder image to each card as a mock.
